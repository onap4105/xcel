**OpenSearch OSS vs Elasticsearch OSS: Key Differences**

1. **Origin and Governance:**
   - **Elasticsearch OSS:** Developed by Elastic, originally under Apache 2.0. Post-2021, new features are under the SSPL (not OSI-approved), but the core remains Apache 2.0.
   - **OpenSearch OSS:** Forked from Elasticsearch 7.10.2 by AWS, maintained by a community under Apache 2.0. Aims to stay fully open-source.

2. **Licensing:**
   - Both core engines are Apache 2.0, but **Elasticsearch**'s newer features (post-7.x) are SSPL-licensed, limiting their use in OSS distributions.
   - **OpenSearch** guarantees all features remain under Apache 2.0, avoiding SSPL restrictions.

3. **Features:**
   - **OpenSearch OSS:** Includes features Elastic formerly restricted to commercial licenses (e.g., security plugins, alerting, anomaly detection) as open source.
   - **Elasticsearch OSS:** Lacks advanced features now under SSPL (e.g., advanced security, machine learning). Focuses on core search/analytics.

4. **Versioning and Compatibility:**
   - **Elasticsearch OSS:** Now at 8.x, with breaking API changes. Older clients/tools may require updates.
   - **OpenSearch OSS:** Starts at 1.x (based on Elasticsearch 7.10.2) and evolves independently. Maintains backward compatibility with Elasticsearch 7.x APIs.

5. **Ecosystem:**
   - **Elasticsearch:** Integrates with Elastic's commercial stack (e.g., Kibana under SSPL, Observability, SIEM).
   - **OpenSearch:** Includes open-source OpenSearch Dashboards (Kibana fork) and prioritizes AWS integration (e.g., AWS Cognito, CloudWatch).

6. **Community and Support:**
   - **Elasticsearch:** Backed by Elastic with commercial support. Development driven by Elastic’s roadmap.
   - **OpenSearch:** Community-driven with AWS backing. Prioritizes transparency and community contributions.

7. **Use Cases:**
   - **Choose Elasticsearch OSS** if you need the latest core improvements and can navigate SSPL limitations.
   - **Choose OpenSearch OSS** for open-source advanced features (security, alerting), AWS integration, or to avoid SSPL.

**Summary Table:**

| Aspect                | Elasticsearch OSS                          | OpenSearch OSS                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **License**           | Apache 2.0 (core), SSPL for new features   | Apache 2.0 (entire project)                 |
| **Advanced Features** | Limited (SSPL features excluded)           | Included (security, ML, alerting)           |
| **Version Base**      | Current (8.x+)                             | Forked from Elasticsearch 7.10.2, now 2.x   |
| **Ecosystem**         | Elastic’s commercial tools (SSPL)          | AWS integration, open-source Dashboards     |
| **Governance**        | Elastic-led                                | Community-driven with AWS support           |
| **Best For**          | Latest core features, Elastic ecosystem    | Open-source compliance, AWS users, security | 

**Decision Guide:**
- **Prioritize open-source ethos?** → OpenSearch.
- **Need advanced features without pay?** → OpenSearch.
- **Rely on Elastic’s latest innovations?** → Elasticsearch OSS (with SSPL awareness).
- **AWS environment?** → OpenSearch for seamless integration.
