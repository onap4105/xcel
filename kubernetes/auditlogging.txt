Enable K8s Audit Logging and Threat Detection: create US
 Kubernetes audit logging capabilities are disabled by default. Kubernetes audit logs can help you to detect unusual activity in your clusters. Collect Kubernetes audit logs to track everything that happens inside your Kubernetes clusters, including every call made to the Kubernetes API by any service. This includes the control plane (built-in controllers, the scheduler), node daemons (the kubelet, kube-proxy, and others), cluster services (such as the cluster autoscaler), users making kubectl requests, and even the Kubernetes API itself.
