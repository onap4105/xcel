Here’s a concise summary of the issue when mapping fields like kubernetes.label.app=kibana and kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/name=fluentbit:

Core Issue
Elasticsearch’s default behavior interprets dots (.) in field names as nested objects. For example:

kubernetes.label.app=kibana is mapped as a field: kubernetes → label → app.

kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/name=fluentbit is split into a nested hierarchy: kubernetes → label → app → kubernetes → io → name.

This creates a conflict because:

The first field (app) is treated as a value field (e.g., keyword or text).

The second field (app.kubernetes.io/name) is treated as a nested object under app.

Elasticsearch cannot merge a field (app) and a nested object (app.kubernetes.io/name) in the same mapping path.

Consequences
Mapping Errors: Elasticsearch throws a mapper_parsing_exception because it cannot dynamically create a nested object (app.kubernetes.io) when app already exists as a simple field.

Data Loss: One or both fields will fail to index, making them unavailable in Kibana.

Solutions
To preserve both fields as flat key-value pairs (e.g., app=kibana and app.kubernetes.io/name=fluentbit under kubernetes.label):

1. Use flattened for kubernetes.label
json
Copy
PUT /your-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "kubernetes.label": {
        "type": "flattened"
      }
    }
  }
}
Result: All subfields (including app and app.kubernetes.io/name) are stored as keywords.

2. Dynamic Template to Force keyword Mapping
json
Copy
PUT /your-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic_templates": [{
      "kubernetes_labels": {
        "path_match": "kubernetes.label.*",
        "mapping": { "type": "keyword" }
      }
    }]
  }
}
Result: Dotted fields like app.kubernetes.io/name are treated as single keywords (no splitting).

Why This Works
Both solutions prevent Elasticsearch from splitting dotted field names into nested objects. This ensures kubernetes.label.app and kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/name are indexed as separate, flat fields, resolving the mapping conflict.

After applying the fix, refresh the Kibana index pattern to access the fields.

Summary of the Issue
When mapping fields like kubernetes.label.app and kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/instance in Elasticsearch/Kibana:

Core Problem
Elasticsearch treats dots (.) in field names as nested object separators by default.

Example: kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/instance is split into a hierarchy:
kubernetes → label → app → kubernetes → io → instance (which doesn’t exist in your data).

Similarly, kubernetes.label.app is split into kubernetes → label → app.

This results in invalid mappings because the actual data has flat fields with dots in their names, not nested objects.

Consequences
Broken Fields:

The fields kubernetes.label.app and kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/instance are not indexed as single fields.

They become inaccessible for searches, filters, or visualizations in Kibana.

Conflicting Mappings:

If kubernetes.label.app is dynamically mapped as an object, attempting to index kubernetes.label.app.kubernetes.io/instance later will fail, as Elasticsearch cannot merge a "nested object" with a "keyword" field.

Solution Overview
To preserve dotted fields as single, searchable fields (e.g., app and app.kubernetes.io/instance under kubernetes.label):

Use the flattened Data Type

Maps the entire kubernetes.label object as a single field, treating subfields like app and app.kubernetes.io/instance as keywords.

Pros: Simple, no nested splitting.

Cons: All subfields are keyword (no text analysis).

Dynamic Templates

Explicitly map all fields under kubernetes.label.* as keyword to prevent splitting:

json
Copy
"dynamic_templates": [{
  "labels": {
    "path_match": "kubernetes.label.*",
    "mapping": { "type": "keyword", "ignore_above": 256 }
  }
}]
Pros: Granular control over specific subfields.

Key Takeaway
Without explicit mapping, Elasticsearch misinterprets dots in field names as nested objects, breaking Kibana functionality. Use flattened or dynamic templates to ensure dotted fields (like app and app.kubernetes.io/instance) are stored as flat keywords. Refresh Kibana’s index pattern after updating mappings.
