Enabled streamlined and automated Kubernetes cluster patch updates using customized Ansible playbooks with Kubespray, improving operational efficiency, consistency, and security. This approach reduced manual effort and risk during patching by leveraging infrastructure-as-code, ensured repeatable and version-controlled updates across environments, and helped maintain cluster stability with minimal downtime. Updates were orchestrated through Azure DevOps pipelines with dynamic configuration, allowing flexible, parameter-driven execution across multiple environments. This setup also enabled quicker adoption of critical fixes and security patches while preserving existing workloads, configurations, and access controls.

Implemented offline in-place Kubernetes version upgrades for the first time, eliminating the need to redeploy running microservices or reconfigure operational environments. This milestone significantly reduced downtime and operational complexity by preserving all existing workloads, user access, role-based permissions, and infrastructure configurations. The new upgrade process streamlined workflows, minimized disruption to DevOps and operations teams, and enhanced overall system availability, reliability, and maintainabilityâ€”especially in air-gapped environments where external network access is restricted.



Successfully upgraded an offline Kubernetes deployment from version v1.28.6 to v1.31.4 using customized, in-sourced Kubespray packages (v2.25.1, v2.26.0, and v2.27.0). Each version was tailored for fully offline deployments by packaging all required container images, OS packages, and dependencies locally, leveraging a JFrog proxy to retrieve and mirror resources within the isolated environment. Playbooks were modified to reference internal repositories and registries. Security was strengthened through CIS benchmark-aligned configurations, TLS enforcement, and hardened control plane components. Custom enhancements included support for custom CNI plugins, internal DNS, trusted certificate management, and improved logging and monitoring integration. All configurations were automated using Azure DevOps pipelines with dynamic parameters, and each version was rigorously tested and validated in offline staging environments to ensure upgrade compatibility, reproducibility, and operational reliability.
