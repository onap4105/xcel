1. Successfully upgraded an offline Kubernetes deployment from version v1.28.6 to v1.31.4 using customized in-sourced Kubespray packages (v2.25.1, v2.26.0, and v2.27.0). Each Kubespray version was tailored to support fully offline deployments by packaging all required container images, OS packages, and dependencies locally, using a JFrog proxy to retrieve and mirror these resources within the isolated environment. and modifying playbooks to reference internal repositories and registries. Security was enhanced through CIS benchmark-aligned configurations, TLS enforcement, and hardened control plane components. Additional custom features included support for custom CNI plugins, internal DNS, trusted certificate management, and improved logging and monitoring integration. All versions were tested and validated in isolated offline environments to ensure upgrade compatibility, reproducibility, and operational reliability.
