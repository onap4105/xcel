Successfully upgraded an offline Kubernetes deployment from version v1.28.6 to v1.31.4 using customized, in-sourced Kubespray packages (v2.25.1, v2.26.0, and v2.27.0). Each version was tailored for fully offline deployments by packaging all required container images, OS packages, and dependencies locally, leveraging a JFrog proxy to retrieve and mirror resources within the isolated environment. Playbooks were modified to reference internal repositories and registries. Security was strengthened through CIS benchmark-aligned configurations, TLS enforcement, and hardened control plane components. Custom enhancements included support for custom CNI plugins, internal DNS, trusted certificate management, and improved logging and monitoring integration. All configurations were automated using Azure DevOps pipelines with dynamic parameters, and each version was rigorously tested and validated in offline staging environments to ensure upgrade compatibility, reproducibility, and operational reliability.
